Snake Game (Core Java)

Overview
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using core Java. The player controls a snake to eat food, grow in length, and avoid collisions with walls or its own body. The game is built using Java Swing for the graphical interface and follows object-oriented programming principles.

Features
Core Java: Built entirely using core Java, with no external libraries.
Keyboard Controls: Smooth and responsive controls for moving the snake.
Score Tracking: Displays the player's current score based on the snake’s growth.
Collision Detection: Ends the game if the snake collides with the walls or itself.
Increasing Difficulty: The game becomes more challenging as the snake grows.

Installation & Running the Game
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/bhavani2003/classic-snake-core-java.git
2. Compile the code: Make sure you have Java installed. Navigate to the project directory and compile the code:
javac snakegame.java
3. Run the game: After compiling, you can run the game with:
java snakegame

How to Play
Arrow keys: Control the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right).
Objective: Guide the snake to eat food and grow, while avoiding collisions with walls or the snake’s own body.

Future Enhancements
Add levels with increasing complexity.
Implement obstacles and power-ups for added challenge.
Improve graphics and animations.
